# WP Rollback
Quickly and easily rollback any theme or plugin on WordPress.org to a previous version without any of the manual fuss. Works just like the plugin updater, except you're downgrading to a specific version. No need for manually downloading and FTPing up the files, this plugin takes care of that for you.
