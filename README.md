# WP Rollback
Quickly and easily rollback any theme or plugin on WordPress.org to a previous version without any of the manual fuss. Works just like the plugin updater, except you're downgrading to a specific version. No need for manually downloading and FTPing up the files, this plugin takes care of that for you.

## Important: Usage Disclaimer

We strongly recommend you perform a test rollback on a staging site and create a complete backup of your WordPress files and database prior to performing a rollback. **We are not responsible for any misuse, deletions, white screens, fatal errors, or any other issue arising from using this plugin**.

## Download
You can download the latest development version from here. Stable versions can be found at the [WordPress Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rollback), or by searching in your WordPress Dashboard in the "Plugins > Add New" area.

## Support
We answer all support requests at the [WordPress Repository](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-rollback). If you have feature requests or bugs or want to contribute, feel free to do that here.

## Documentation
WP Rollback was created to be as intuitive to the natural WordPress experience as possible. There are no settings at all. We believe that once you activate WP Rollback you'll quickly discover exactly how it works without question.
